Hello!

This website is a collection of my mechanical engineering projects that I have worked on over the last few years to showcase my experience and skills as well as to provide some insight for others that might be interested in similar projects. 

## About Me

I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Riverside. During my junior and senior years, I worked as an assistant in the mechanical engineering makerspace and conducted research in the Robotics and Medical Systems Lab.

At the makerspace, I fabricated parts for research labs, serviced equipment, led operational and design-for-manufacturing workshops, and managed material inventory. This role also gave me hands-on training with tools like desktop CNC routers, PolyJet and MultiJet printers, waterjets, and laser cutters, which I applied to personal projects like my robotic arm.

Beyond fabrication, I have experience in mechanical design, mechanism design for robotics, and rapid prototyping.

## Robot Arm

This was my senior design project with five other students with the goal of developing a cross functional robotic arm to create mixed drinks to order within a 10 week period. I led the mechanical design,  fabrication, and electronics planning throughout the project.

## Fruit Picker

This was my contribution as a researcher in the Robotics and Medical Systems (RaMS) Lab. My task was to develop an end effector for a continuum robot that would travel through tree branches to access hanging fruit from the interior of tree canopies. Once the continuum robot is in place the end effector will grasp the fruit, twist and pull to remove the fruit from the tree.

## Rocket Tracker

For my universityâ€™s liquid rocketry club, I developed a proof-of-concept rocket tracker to receive telemetry throughout flight. Several prototypes were built, but the project was eventually paused so the team could focus on preparing for launch.

## Straw Bridge Challenge

The final project for Machine Design was a challenge to design, build and test straw bridges. Grades were based on failure load prediction and performance efficiency compared to the class average. My group ended up scoring the highest efficiency ever in the class's history with an efficiency of 732%. Our success came from multiple simulation iterations to refine the design and several prototypes to ensure build quality.
