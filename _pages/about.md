Hello!

This website is a collection of my mechanical engineering projects that I have worked on over the last few years to showcase my experience and skills as well as to provide some insight for others that might be interested in similar projects. 

### About Me

I graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a BSME degree. In my last two years as an undergraduate I worked in the mechanical engineering makerspace as an assistant as well as a researcher in the Robotics and Medical Systems. 

As a student assitant as in the mechanical engineering makerspace my responsibilities included fabricating parts to order, servicing equipment, leading operational workshops and managing materials. As part of my training in the makerspace, I learned to use the equipment for my own projects such as a robot arm. Some of the machinery I worked with included desktop CNC routers, polyjet and multijet printers, waterjets and laser cutters.

Much of my experience revolves around mechanical design, mechaism design for robotics, rapid prototyping and fabrication. Below are some projects where I applied some of the skills I have picked up over the last few years.
