Hello!

This website is a collection of my mechanical engineering projects that I have worked on over the last few years to showcase my experience and skills as well as to provide some insight for others that might be interested in similar projects. 

## About Me

I graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a BSME degree. In my last two years as an undergraduate I worked in the mechanical engineering makerspace as an assistant as well as a researcher in the Robotics and Medical Systems. 

At the makerspace, my responsibilities included fabricating parts to order for research labs, servicing equipment, leading operational and design for manufacturing workshops in addition to managing material inventory. As part of my training in the makerspace, I learned to use the equipment for my own projects such as a robot arm. Some of the machinery I worked with included desktop CNC routers, polyjet and multijet printers, waterjets and laser cutters.

Outside of fabrication, my experience includes mechanical design, mechaism design for robotics and rapid prototyping. Below are some projects where I applied some of the skills I have picked up over the last few years. 

## Robot Arm

This was my senior design project with five other students with the goal of developing a cross functional robotic arm to create mixed drinks to order within a 10 week period. I led the mechanical design,  fabrication, and electronics planning throughout the project.

## Fruit Picker

This was my contribution as a researcher in the Robotics and Medical Systems (RaMS) Lab. My task was to develop an end effector for a continuum robot that would travel through tree branches to access hanging fruit from the interior of tree canopies. Once the continuum robot is in place the end effector will grasp the fruit, twist and pull to remove the fruit from the tree.

## Rocket Tracker

For the university's liquid rocketry club I developed a proof of concept rocket tracker to receive telemtery from the rocket throughout its flight. A few prototypes were created but was ultimately terminated to focus on preparing for rocket launch.

## Straw Bridge Challenge

The final project for Machine Design was a challenge to design, build and test straw bridges. Grades were based on failure load prediction and performance efficiency compared to the class average. My group ended up scoring the highest efficiency ever in the class's history with an efficiency of 732%. Our success was attributed performing several iterations of simulation to find the most effecient design while building several prototypes to ensure the best build quality.
