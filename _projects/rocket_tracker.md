### Situation
This project was for the liquid rocketry club at the University of California, Riverside. The goal of this project was to develop ground support equipment that would receive telemetry throughout the flight and descent of an amateur liquid rocket

Since everyone must remain inside bunkers during launch and landing, the club wanted equipment to automatically track the rocket via a yagi antenna to receive live data such as propellant pressure.

The Design constraints were as follows:
-  The system shall move a payload of 500 grams
-  The system shall be capable of pointing to any point in a hemisphere
-  The system shall cost less than $100 in total
-  The system shall mount to the end of a 10 ft pole

Through a few whiteboarding sessions, it was determined to be the best balance between effectiveness and cost since the wrist could output twice the amount of torque and was mechanically simpler compared to other ideas generated.



Below is the proof of concept prototype. No motor curves were available for the recycled 3D-printer motors, so we couldnâ€™t perform detailed torque or speed calculations.

The prototype was wired up and coded using an Arduino and tmc2208 stepper motor drivers. The plan for tracking the rocket was to use computer vision to follow the rocket on the way up and the parachute on the way down however this project was ultimately put on hold to prepare the rocket for launch.
